Not less than twitter, facebook, or any other well known company providing third party widgets out there.</p>\n<p>We also can not accept the fact that our plugin will be removed without notice, and without any time to make changes, right out of the blue.</p>\n<p>We can not accept that messages that we post on the plugin forum will be removed just because the moderators don&#8217;t like them, or decide that they are against rules that they have created themselves. Rules they don&#8217;t want to reconsider.</p>\n<p>They are free to make any decision they like, after all, its their hosting and their rules. Can&#8217;t ignore that, luckily enough we don&#8217;t have to accept them.</p>\n<p>If you want to complain, don&#8217;t complain here, try and complain on the forums, but my guess is that you will be moderated, wordpress.org is not a democracy, nor is it a GPL compliant site, everything there must be free, in cost, and in speech, that is the reason you got tons of crippled plugins that only serve as promotion to a pro version. This is also what they suggested that we do with Transposh. And we don&#8217;t like it, not one bit.</p>\n<p>If a next version will ever be uploaded to that site, it will be a crippled version, (without any links here, for sure) and not the most usable version. The latest version (non crippled) will be served right here on the <a title="Download" href="http://transposh.org/download/">download page</a>. To which we will now have to add an update mechanism.</p>\n<p>Feel free to discuss this in the comments here.</p>\n<p>So long wordpress.org, and thanks for all the fish.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/transposh/~4/-TNqvaAj35U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://transposh.org/goodbye-wordpress-org/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"44";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://transposh.org/goodbye-wordpress-org/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";s:4:"href";s:37:"http://feeds.feedburner.com/transposh";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:2:{s:3:"rel";s:3:"hub";s:4:"href";s:32:"http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:4:"info";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:3:"uri";s:9:"transposh";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:11:{s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:15:20 GMT";s:4:"etag";s:27:"GawgB+REDCgVi4uwerhnD9pXxP0";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=UTF-8";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";s:4:"date";s:29:"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:15:20 GMT";s:7:"expires";s:29:"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:15:20 GMT";s:13:"cache-control";s:18:"private, max-age=0";s:22:"x-content-type-options";s:7:"nosniff";s:16:"x-xss-protection";s:13:"1; mode=block";s:14:"content-length";s:4:"8498";s:6:"server";s:3:"GSE";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20170519173134";}', 'no');

Using our services</h3>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br ><br>\r\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. RA Rating</h3>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Information on the services</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">5. Legal services for consumers</h3>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">6. Premium services for lawyers</h3>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br><br>\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br><br>\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">7. Legal advertising and communications</h3>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">8.

Software</h3>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA does not screen such information for accuracy or reliability. to the fullest extent permitted by law, ra and its affiliates, suppliers and distributors make no warranties, either express or implied, about the services or software. the services and software are provided “as is.” ra also disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">11. Limitation of liability</h3>\r\n<p>TO The fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall ra or any of its affiliates, suppliers and distributors, or any of their respective directors, employees and agents, be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) the outcome of any legal matter; (b) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the services or software; (c) any conduct or content of any third party relating to the services or software; or (d) unauthorized access, use or alteration of legal information.<br><br>\r\nTo the extent permitted by law, the total liability of ra, and its affiliates, suppliers and distributors, for any claim arising out of or relating in any manner to the use of the services or software, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the services to which such claim relates in the 12 month period preceding the filing of such claim. In the interest of clarity, this limitation also applies to premium services.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h3>\r\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br><br>\r\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">13. Indemnification</h3>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">14. Modifications</h3>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h3>\r\n<h3 class="trms"> Please read this section carefully, as it affects your rights.</h3> \r\n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <span style="color:#444444;">individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br><br>\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought.

In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">18. Entire agreement</h3>\r\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h3>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later.

You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void.

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to your use of RA website, products, apps, and services (together, the "Services"). The Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use information so you can make an informed decision about using the Services. Please read it carefully before using the Services or submitting any information to us. If you do not agree to any part of this Policy, then you should stop accessing the Services. \r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-md-12 pclass">\r\n<h3 class="trms" style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin: 5px 0 0 0;">What information do we collect?</h3>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">1. Usage/log information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. Cookies </h3>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br><br>\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br><br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:4px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">1. Non-personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br><br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Third party service providers</h3>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:4px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n<h3 class="trms">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 class="trms">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br><br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br><br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br><br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Changes to the policy</h3>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'privacy-policy', '', '', '2018-03-23 06:45:22', '2018-03-23 06:45:22', '', 0, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/?page_id=110', 0, 'page', '', 0),

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to your use of RA website, products, apps, and services (together, the "Services"). The Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use information so you can make an informed decision about using the Services. Please read it carefully before using the Services or submitting any information to us. If you do not agree to any part of this Policy, then you should stop accessing the Services. \n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col-md-12 pclass">\n<h3 class="trms" style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin: 5px 0 0 0;">What information do we collect?</h3>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">1. Usage/log information</h3>\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">2. Cookies </h3>\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br><br>\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \n</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">3. Personal information</h3>\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.\n<br>\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br><br>\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \n</p>\n<br><br>\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">1. Non-personal information</h3>\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br><br>\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">2. Personal information</h3>\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">3. Third party service providers</h3>\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.\n<br>\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">4. Text messaging</h3>\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\n</p>\n<br><br>\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\n<h3 class="trms">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\n<br>\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\n<p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\n</p>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h3>\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h3>\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\n\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\n</p>\n\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h3>\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h3>\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\n\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h3>\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\n<br>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-autosave-v1', '', '', '2018-03-23 06:41:44', '2018-03-23 06:41:44', '', 110, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/blog/2018/03/20/110-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using our services</h3>\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br ><br>\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">2. RA Rating</h3>\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">3. Information on the services</h3>\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">5. Legal services for consumers</h3>\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">6. Premium services for lawyers</h3>\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br><br>\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br><br>\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">7. Legal advertising and communications</h3>\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">8. Copyright</h3>\n<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.<br />\n If you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, please contact us:</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">9. Software</h3>\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">11. Limitation of liability</h3>\n<p>TO The fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall ra or any of its affiliates, suppliers and distributors, or any of their respective directors, employees and agents, be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) the outcome of any legal matter; (b) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the services or software; (c) any conduct or content of any third party relating to the services or software; or (d) unauthorized access, use or alteration of legal information.<br><br>\nTo the extent permitted by law, the total liability of ra, and its affiliates, suppliers and distributors, for any claim arising out of or relating in any manner to the use of the services or software, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the services to which such claim relates in the 12 month period preceding the filing of such claim. In the interest of clarity, this limitation also applies to premium services.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h3>\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br><br>\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">13. Indemnification</h3>\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">14. Modifications</h3>\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h3>\n<h3 class="trms"> Please read this section carefully, as it affects your rights.</h3> \n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <span style="color:#444444;">individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br><br>\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a> </span></p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">16. Applicable law</h3>\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">17. Termination</h3>\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">18. Entire agreement</h3>\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h3>\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\n<br>\n<h3 class="trms">20.

Using our services</h3>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br ><br>\r\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. RA Rating</h3>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Information on the services</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">5. Legal services for consumers</h3>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">6. Premium services for lawyers</h3>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br><br>\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br><br>\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">7. Legal advertising and communications</h3>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">8.

Software</h3>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">11. Limitation of liability</h3>\r\n<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL MATTER; (B) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION.<br><br>\r\n TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RA, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES TO WHICH SUCH CLAIM RELATES IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FILING OF SUCH CLAIM. IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h3>\r\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br><br>\r\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">13. Indemnification</h3>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">14. Modifications</h3>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h3>\r\n<h3 class="trms"> Please read this section carefully, as it affects your rights.</h3> \r\n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <span style="color:#000;">individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br><br>\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a> </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">16. Applicable law</h3>\r\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">17. Termination</h3>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">18. Entire agreement</h3>\r\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h3>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">20.

This notice may be sent via email to: legal@rightadvice.ae.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">16. Applicable law</h2>\r\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">17. Termination</h2>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">18. Entire agreement</h2>\r\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h2>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">20.

Using our services</h2>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br>\r\n\r\nUsing our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. RA Rating</h2>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Information on the services</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h2>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">5. Legal services for consumers</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">6. Premium services for lawyers</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email (cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae). Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br>\r\n\r\nIf your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br>\r\n\r\nPremium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">7. Legal advertising and communications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">8. Copyright</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.<br>\r\nIf you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, please contact us:\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">9. Software</h2>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h2>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">11. Limitation of liability</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL MATTER; (B) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION.<br>\r\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RA, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES TO WHICH SUCH CLAIM RELATES IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FILING OF SUCH CLAIM. IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">12. User posted content & other interactive services or areas</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br>\r\nWhen you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">13. Indemnification</h2>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">14. Modifications</h2>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h2>\r\n<p><strong> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong><br>\r\nWe hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to legal@rightadvice.ae.  However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <b>individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.</b> The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br>\r\n\r\nBefore moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought.

The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br><br>\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought.

Using our services</h2>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br>\r\n\r\nUsing our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. RA Rating</h2>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Information on the services</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h2>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">5. Legal services for consumers</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">6. Premium services for lawyers</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email (cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae). Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br>\r\n\r\nIf your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br>\r\n\r\nPremium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">7. Legal advertising and communications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">8. Copyright</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.<br>\r\nIf you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, please contact us:\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">9. Software</h2>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h2>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">11. Limitation of liability</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL MATTER; (B) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION.<br>\r\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RA, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES TO WHICH SUCH CLAIM RELATES IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FILING OF SUCH CLAIM. IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">12. User posted content & other interactive services or areas</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk.

If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">13. Indemnification</h2>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">14.

Using our services</h3>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br ><br>\r\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. RA Rating</h3>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Information on the services</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">5. Legal services for consumers</h3>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">6. Premium services for lawyers</h3>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br><br>\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br><br>\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">7. Legal advertising and communications</h3>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">8.

Premium services for lawyers</h3>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br><br>\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br><br>\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”).

The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br><br>\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought.

Using our services</h2>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br>\r\n\r\nUsing our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. RA Rating</h2>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Information on the services</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h2>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">5. Legal services for consumers</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">6.

Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>.

Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br>\r\n\r\nPremium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”).

Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. RA Rating</h2>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Information on the services</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h2>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">5. Legal services for consumers</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">6. Premium services for lawyers</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br>\r\n\r\nIf your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br>\r\n\r\nPremium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">7. Legal advertising and communications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">8. Copyright</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.<br>\r\nIf you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, please contact us:\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">9. Software</h2>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h2>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">11. Limitation of liability</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL MATTER; (B) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION.<br>\r\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RA, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES TO WHICH SUCH CLAIM RELATES IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FILING OF SUCH CLAIM. IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">12. User posted content & other interactive services or areas</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nRA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br>\r\nWhen you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">13. Indemnification</h2>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">14. Modifications</h2>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h2>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size:16px;"> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong><br>\r\nWe hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <strong >individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.</strong > The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br>\r\n\r\nBefore moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">16.

These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h2>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">20.

Using our services</h2>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br />\r\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. RA Rating</h2>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Information on the services</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h2>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">5. Legal services for consumers</h2>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">6. Premium services for lawyers</h2>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br />\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br />\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">7. Legal advertising and communications</h2>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">8. Copyright</h2>\r\n<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.<br />\r\n If you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, please contact us:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">9. Software</h2>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h2>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">11. Limitation of liability</h2>\r\n<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL MATTER; (B) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION.<br />\r\n TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RA, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES TO WHICH SUCH CLAIM RELATES IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FILING OF SUCH CLAIM. IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h2>\r\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br />\r\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">13. Indemnification</h2>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">14. Modifications</h2>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h2>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size: 16px;"> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong><br />\r\n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <strong>individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br />\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a> </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">16. Applicable law</h2>\r\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">17. Termination</h2>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">18.

Waiver, severability, and assignment</h2>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later.

You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void.

By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h2>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size:16px;"> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong><br>\r\nWe hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <strong >individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.</strong > The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br>\r\n\r\nBefore moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">16.

These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h2>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">20.

This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Cookies </h2>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions.

Personal information</h2>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Publicly posted Information</h2>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h2>How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Non-personal information</h2>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h2>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h2>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h2>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Managing your preferences</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h2>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h2>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h2>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h2>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h2>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h2>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h2>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h2>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h2>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:37:10', '2018-03-20 10:37:10', '', 110, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/blog/2018/03/20/110-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h2>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h2>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h2>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h2>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h2>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h2>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h2>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h2>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:39:06', '2018-03-20 10:39:06', '', 110, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/blog/2018/03/20/110-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Usage/log information</h2>\r\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Cookies </h2>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Personal information</h2>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Publicly posted Information</h2>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:20px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Non-personal information</h2>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h2>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h2>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h2>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:20px;">Managing your preferences</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">1.

You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion.

We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h2>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h2>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h2>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h2>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h2>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h2>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h2>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h2>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h2>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h2>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h2>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h2>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:42:14', '2018-03-20 10:42:14', '', 110, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/blog/2018/03/20/110-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Usage/log information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. Cookies </h3>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br><br>\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br><br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">1.

We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br><br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2.

Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Non-personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h3>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h3>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-23 06:31:48', '2018-03-23 06:31:48', '', 110, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/blog/2018/03/23/110-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Using our services</h3>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br />\r\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. RA Rating</h3>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Information on the services</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">5. Legal services for consumers</h3>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">6. Premium services for lawyers</h3>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br />\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br />\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">7. Legal advertising and communications</h3>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">8. Copyright</h3>\r\n<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.<br />\r\n If you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, please contact us:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">9. Software</h3>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">11. Limitation of liability</h3>\r\n<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL MATTER; (B) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION.<br />\r\n TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RA, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES TO WHICH SUCH CLAIM RELATES IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FILING OF SUCH CLAIM. IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h3>\r\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br />\r\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">13. Indemnification</h3>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">14. Modifications</h3>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h3>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size: 16px;"> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong><br />\r\n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <strong>individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br />\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a> </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">16. Applicable law</h3>\r\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">17. Termination</h3>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">18. Entire agreement</h3>\r\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h3>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void.

Using our services</h2>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br />\r\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">2. RA Rating</h2>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Information on the services</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h2>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">5. Legal services for consumers</h2>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">6. Premium services for lawyers</h2>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br />\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br />\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">7. Legal advertising and communications</h2>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">8.

Software</h2>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h2>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">11. Limitation of liability</h2>\r\n<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL MATTER; (B) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION.<br />\r\n TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RA, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES TO WHICH SUCH CLAIM RELATES IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FILING OF SUCH CLAIM. IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h2>\r\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br />\r\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">13. Indemnification</h2>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">14. Modifications</h2>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h2>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size: 16px;"> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong><br />\r\n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <strong>individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br />\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a> </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">16. Applicable law</h2>\r\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">17. Termination</h2>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">18. Entire agreement</h2>\r\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h2>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">20.

You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <strong>individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br />\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a> </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">16. Applicable law</h2>\r\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">17. Termination</h2>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">18. Entire agreement</h2>\r\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h2>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">20.

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to your use of RA website, products, apps, and services (together, the "Services"). The Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use information so you can make an informed decision about using the Services. Please read it carefully before using the Services or submitting any information to us. If you do not agree to any part of this Policy, then you should stop accessing the Services. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-md-12 pclass">\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1;">What information do we collect?</h3><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Usage/log information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Cookies </h3>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Non-personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h3>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h3>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-23 06:30:04', '2018-03-23 06:30:04', '', 110, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/blog/2018/03/23/110-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h2>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h2>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h2>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h2>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h2>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h2>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h2>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website.

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to your use of RA website, products, apps, and services (together, the "Services"). The Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use information so you can make an informed decision about using the Services. Please read it carefully before using the Services or submitting any information to us. If you do not agree to any part of this Policy, then you should stop accessing the Services. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-6 laydiss"><img src="http://35.154.128.159:83/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/laywer-diss.jpg" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-md-12 pclass">\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1;">What information do we collect?</h3><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Usage/log information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Cookies </h3>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Non-personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h3>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused.

Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h3>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-22 09:02:27', '2018-03-22 09:02:27', '', 110, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/blog/2018/03/22/110-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Using our services</h3>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br />\r\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. Except in the context of browsing or accessing our Services in accordance with these Terms, you may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. RA Rating</h3>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Information on the services</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">5. Legal services for consumers</h3>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">6. Premium services for lawyers</h3>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br />\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br />\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">7. Legal advertising and communications</h3>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">8. Copyright</h3>\r\n<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.<br />\r\n If you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, please contact us:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">9. Software</h3>\r\n<p>We use proprietary software and as such it is covered under RA’s Trademark.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">11. Limitation of liability</h3>\r\n<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RA OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) THE OUTCOME OF ANY LEGAL MATTER; (B) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION.<br />\r\n TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF RA, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY MANNER TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES TO WHICH SUCH CLAIM RELATES IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FILING OF SUCH CLAIM. IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h3>\r\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br />\r\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">13. Indemnification</h3>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">14. Modifications</h3>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h3>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size: 16px;"> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong><br />\r\n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <strong>individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br />\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a> </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">16. Applicable law</h3>\r\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">17. Termination</h3>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">18. Entire agreement</h3>\r\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h3>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">20.

You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">6. Premium services for lawyers</h3>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br><br>\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br><br>\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">7. Legal advertising and communications</h3>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">8.

Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY.

IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h3>\r\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br><br>\r\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media.

Modifications</h3>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h3>\r\n<h3 class="trms"> Please read this section carefully, as it affects your rights.</h3><br> \r\n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <span style="color:#000;">individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br><br>\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent via email to: <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae.</a> </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">16. Applicable law</h3>\r\n<p>The laws of the UAE, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">17. Termination</h3>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other data.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">18. Entire agreement</h3>\r\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RA with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h3>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">20.

Using our services</h3>\r\n<p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with RA. No use of the Services is permitted by those under the age of majority in their country of residence. In no event is use of the Services permitted by those under the age of 13. If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, then you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of that entity.<br ><br>\r\n Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access.

Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. RA Rating</h3>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Information on the services</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services display both RA-created content and content that is not created or developed by RA (the "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Services. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">5. Legal services for consumers</h3>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf.

This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on RA, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or quality of any such Legal Information, or the qualifications of those posting it.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. No formation of an attorney-client relationship</h3>\r\n<p>The Legal Information found on RA is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. The Legal Information is not the provision of legal services, and accessing such information, or corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Services, or otherwise using the Services, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and RA, or you and any lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information. You understand that questions and answers or other postings to the Services are not confidential and are not subject to attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">5. Legal services for consumers</h3>\r\n<p>RA is a platform where lawyers unaffiliated with RA can offer information and interact with consumers. We provide a number of methods by which you can purchase legal services or have a direct, confidential discussion of your legal issues with a lawyer. Although some of these methods involve RA processing a transaction on your behalf, in all instances, RA is simply the intermediary in such transactions. You are liable for paying the lawyer for the services provided. RA has no liability, either primarily or secondarily, for paying the lawyer other than as an agent on your behalf. The fees you pay for such services are charged by the lawyer and passed through to the lawyer once services have been rendered. Any attorney-client relationship formed as a result of such discussions is between you and the lawyer you speak with—not between you and RA. Furthermore, you understand that RA cannot be held responsible for the quality or accuracy of any information or legal services provided by lawyers you connect with via RA.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">6. Premium services for lawyers</h3>\r\n<p>RA offers optional Premium Services for lawyers. By selecting a Premium Service you agree to pay RA the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service. Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Premium Service goes into effect and will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments will continue to be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your service. The amount of the monthly recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Premium Service you selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable subscription fee increases. Premium Services must be cancelled prior to your monthly renewal in order to avoid billing of the next month\'s Premium Service fee. RA must receive written notice of your cancellation or reduction in service at least thirty (30) days in advance of the monthly renewal date on which you wish to make the cancellation or reduction effective. All cancellations or reductions of advertising services must be received in writing by email <a href="mailto:cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae">(cancel.ads@rightadvice.ae)</a>. Premium Service fees are not prorated or refundable.<br><br>\r\n If your payment method fails or your account is past due, RA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Premium Services. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to RA within sixty (60) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.<br><br>\r\n Premium Services may include the publication of advertising or website content you provide to us (the “Premium Services Content”). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Premium Services Content posted on RA or websites supported by RA. You give RA, our affiliates, providers of third party services, and subcontractors a non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute the Premium Services Content (in whole or in part) in providing the Services.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">7. Legal advertising and communications</h3>\r\n<p>It is solely the responsibility of lawyers, law firms and licensed legal providers to ensure that any information or advertisements they post or place on the RA website (including without limitation any Legal Information), and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Services, fully complies with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of law and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">8.

Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">11.

IN THE INTEREST OF CLARITY, THIS LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO PREMIUM SERVICES.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">12. User posted content &amp; other interactive services or areas</h3>\r\n<p>RA includes interactive areas in which you may post content and information, including peer endorsements and user reviews, questions and answers, comments, photos, and other materials (the "User Content"). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to RA. You are also solely responsible for your use of such interactive features, and use them at your own risk. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.<br><br>\r\n When you post User Content to RA, you give RA and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world in any media. To the extent such content is attached to a profile on the RA platform, the foregoing license includes a right to reproduce your profile, and any name, likeness or photograph contained in such profile. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">13. Indemnification</h3>\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless RA, its corporate affiliates, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and each of their respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any User Content you post, store or otherwise transmit on or through the Services or your use of or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened suit, demand or claim arising out of or relating to the User Content, your conduct, your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">14. Modifications</h3>\r\n<p>RA may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">15. Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h3>\r\n<h3 class="trms"> Please read this section carefully, as it affects your rights.</h3> \r\n We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of your concern to <a href="mailto:legal@rightadvice.ae.">legal@rightadvice.ae. </a> However, if RA is not able to informally resolve your complaint, you and RA agree to <span style="color:#000;">individual binding arbitration under UAE law, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final. The following applies to any arbitration proceedings between you and RA:<br><br>\r\n Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the specific relief sought.

Termination</h3>\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any of these Terms, RA reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Services. RA reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">19. Waiver, severability, and assignment</h3>\r\n<p>RA’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. RA may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">20.

RA Rating</h3>\r\n<p>An RA Rating reflects prior RA user’s assessment of a given lawyer, based upon the information obtained by or submitted to RA. Someone else\'s assessment of the same lawyer may be very different, or be based upon different information. An RA Rating is not an endorsement of any particular lawyer, and is not a guarantee of a lawyer\'s quality, competency, or character. Nor is the RA Rating a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such lawyer is involved. Rather, the RA Rating is intended to be a starting point to gather information about lawyers who may be suitable for your legal needs - but you should not rely solely on the RA Rating in deciding whether to contact or hire any given lawyer.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3.

Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Non-personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h3>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Changes to the policy</h3>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website.

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to your use of RA website, products, apps, and services (together, the "Services"). The Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use information so you can make an informed decision about using the Services.

Usage/log information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. Cookies </h3>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br><br>\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Non-personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h3>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use.

We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.<br>\r\n\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use.

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to your use of RA website, products, apps, and services (together, the "Services"). The Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use information so you can make an informed decision about using the Services. Please read it carefully before using the Services or submitting any information to us. If you do not agree to any part of this Policy, then you should stop accessing the Services. \r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-md-12 pclass">\r\n<h3 class="trms" style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin: 5px 0 0 0;">What information do we collect?</h3>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Usage/log information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Cookies </h3>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Non-personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">3. Third party service providers</h3>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">4. Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\n\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">2. Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.

Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 class="trms">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software and store such credit card information using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.<br>\r\nNo security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.<br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to protect your information and our website from data theft. We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br><br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us as set forth in this Policy.<br>\r\nIn-Short, if you are under 13, you need to have your legal guardian contact us.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Changes to the policy</h3>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time, and we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to this Policy materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to your account email or posting on the RA Blog).<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to our Services, or you wish to verify, correct or delete any Personal Information we have collected, please contact us via contact@rightadvice.ae\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Privacy Policy', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '110-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-23 06:43:30', '2018-03-23 06:43:30', '', 110, 'http://35.154.128.159:83/blog/2018/03/23/110-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to your use of RA website, products, apps, and services (together, the "Services"). The Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use information so you can make an informed decision about using the Services. Please read it carefully before using the Services or submitting any information to us. If you do not agree to any part of this Policy, then you should stop accessing the Services. \r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="col-md-12 pclass">\r\n<h3 class="trms" style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin: 5px 0 0 0;">What information do we collect?</h3>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">1. Usage/log information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes information such as your computer\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the Services, items you click on, pages you view and the amount of time you spend on particular pages.<br>\r\nIn short, we want to know how you our website in-order to help you better\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. Cookies </h3>\r\n<p>We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user\'s computer or device at the request of a website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or "help screen"to learn about these functions. However, if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your RA account or use certain parts of the Services.<br><br>\r\nIn short, these cookies help us remember who you are and what you prefer so that your future visits to our website be more intuitive for you \r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other account number. Personal Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information; (2) any publicly available information about lawyers; (3) information about you that is provided by third parties; or (4) information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services. Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you provide when you (a) create or update your RA account, (b) communicate with us, (c) purchase services from us, (d) contact or recommend a lawyer, (e) submit client ratings or peer endorsements. If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), or post information using your Profile, we may also collect verification information.\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, here again, it is a matter of storing information about you that you input while using our service for the sake of enhancing your experience with us.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. Publicly posted Information</h3>\r\n<p>Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or via your Profile may become publicly available and is no longer considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in your Profile or in client ratings, peer endorsements, or any other interactive areas may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such information publicly, and you should assume that such information will be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to locate information online (e.g., internet archive).<br><br>\r\nIn short, your interactions with lawyers through our website and your personal information are kept confidential. Should you post comments on message boards for instance, that information is considered public. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">How RA uses the information it collects</2>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">1. Non-personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. We may freely publish, disclose and use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.<br><br>\r\nIn short, the only information we might share with external counterparties to allow us to better serve our clients is non-specific to any single client or user.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2. Personal information</h3>\r\n<p>We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.<br>\r\nIn short, rest assured, we use your information to better serve you while protecting your identity.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">3. Third party service providers</h3>\r\n<p>In the event that we engage with third party service providers in connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with such service providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties; (2) you otherwise give us your consent to do so; or (3) in response to a request for information or a subpoena.\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is not to be shared by us unless you wish us to do so, or we receive a court order.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">4. Text messaging</h3>\r\n<p>We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent to the transmission of text messages to such number. You may, however, contact us and opt out of receiving such texts.<br>\r\nIn short, we will not be spamming you with text messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3 style="font-size: 19px; color:#0d7bb1; margin-top:40px;">Managing your preferences</h3>\r\n<h3 class="trms">1. Managing online advertising preferences</h3>\r\n<p>We respect all browser instructions for setting or rejecting cookies on generally available browsers. This is one way to manage your preferences regarding the collection of information by RA. Additionally, and because data acquired across the internet is often associated with information about you acquired in other places online, you can manage online advertising preferences via these links:\r\n<br>\r\nGoogle Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>\r\nFacebook Ad Preferences Manager<br>\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative<br>\r\nDigital Advertising Alliance<br><br>\r\nWhile RA will follow any such preferences, we make no representations regarding whether third parties, including third party ad platforms, will do so.<br>\r\nIn short, as a service provider, we will honor your preferences as to online advertising.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">10. Disclaimers and acknowledgements regarding use of legal information</h3>\r\n<p>While RA strives to provide—and to allow lawyers to provide—useful information regarding lawyers and legal services, there are some things that we cannot guarantee. You acknowledge that such information consists of third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that legal and other information may be incomplete, may contain inaccuracies, or may be based on opinion. RA DOES NOT SCREEN SUCH INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RA AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." RA ALSO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">2.

Managing your newsletter/communications preferences</h3>\r\n<p>You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive newsletters or other communications by changing your account. In addition, you may "opt out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing or promotional email from RA by following the unsubscribe instructions or using the unsubscribe links within the emails we send. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out"of receiving service or account-related emails from RA.<br>\r\nIn short, should you not want to receive any communication from us, we will oblige except for account related communication.\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h3 class="trms">Requests for information; disclosure for enforcement purposes</h3>\r\n<p>We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users\' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies disclosure of Personal Information.<br>\r\nIn short, your personal information is safe and we will only disclose it in the case of a force majeure.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Updating your listing information and public posts</h3>\r\n<p>You can correct certain information by logging into your account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account. In addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing the information contained therein, or by sending us an email.<br>\r\nPlease note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the event an account is closed. For example, we may retain and continue to display any information you provided in connection with a question, answer, endorsement or client review. <br>\r\nIn Short, you can modify or delete your personal information. Other non-personal information might be retained by our site (example, rating or review)which does not contain information about you specifically.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Security measures</h3>\r\n<p>RA endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

We commit to having the latest and most performing data protection mechanisms, however,  no mechanism is perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Third party websites and practices</h3>\r\n<p>In the eventuality, our services contain links to other websites or make available third party services, including ad platforms and technologies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating website before providing any information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn-Short, we do our best to keep your information safe and confidential while on our platform. Once you leave our platform, we cannot be accountable for your data.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Transfers of information</h3>\r\n<p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of RA’s business assets. In such an event, we will attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred, but you may not have the right to opt out of any such transfer.<br><br>\r\nIn-short, RA might be sold wholly or partly, or may require financing to grow. Only the parties involved in such transactions might have access to your information.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3 class="trms">Children</h3>\r\n<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and such use is prohibited by our Terms of use.
